================================================

<img src="https://github.com/moinwiki/moin/blob/master/src/moin/static/logos/moinmoin.svg?raw=true" alt="MoinMoin Logo" width="120" align="right">

MoinMoin is an easy to use, full-featured and extensible wiki software package
written in Python. You can run it on all common operating systems (Windows,
macOS, Linux, etc.).

This wiki software can fulfill a wide range of roles, such as a personal notes
organizer deployed on a laptop or home web server, a company knowledge base
deployed on an intranet, or an Internet server open to individuals sharing the
same interests, goals or projects.


Documentation and Support
=========================

> [!NOTE]
    moin2 is not released yet.

You will find the latest docs at https://moin-20.readthedocs.io/en/latest.

There is a wiki page collecting all moin2 specific information, links to
support resources and info about MoinMoin development status and plans:
https://moinmo.in/MoinMoin2.0

In general, you should make sure that the documentation you are reading
is written for the moin version you are using. Much of the information
you find in the wiki refers to moin 1.9 and does not apply to moin2.

For support, please try the documentation, the homepage, the irc channel,
the mailing lists and the github issues before contacting the MoinMoin
authors directly.

If you have trouble with any web server configuration, please try reading
the web server's documentation. Same thing applies for any other 3rd party
software usually used with moin, but not written by the MoinMoin developers.
