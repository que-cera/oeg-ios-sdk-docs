File upload functionality is accessed through the +modify item view or the
Index view.

To upload a file on the +modify item view, click the browsers Browse/Choose
button. Use the browser's file dialog to select an item, then click the OK button.
The file will be uploaded and saved with the previously chosen content type;
file name suffixes are ignored.

To upload a file or files on the global index navigation view,
start by clicking the `New Item` link to bring the `Create new item` dialog
into view.

From the Index view, there are two methods of uploading files, single file or multiple files.
Uploaded files will be logically placed within the current index, sub-index or namespace.
Multiple file uploads have several restrictions:

 * the files will be uploaded and saved using the current name
 * existing items with the same name will be overwritten
 * the file names should have a valid suffix that defines the file type
 * files without a known suffix will be stored as is and available for download
