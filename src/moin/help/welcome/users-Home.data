= users/Home =

Use this namespace to create your user home page using the namespace and your 
login name as the page name. Example: `users/JoeDoe`

If you are logged in when you create/edit any page 
there will be a link to your home page near the bottom in the item credits.

You are encouraged to fill your home page with any information about yourself
that you are willing to share with other wiki users. If the wiki admin wants 
to encourage some consistency among user home pages there will be a template
offered in the page creation dialog.
